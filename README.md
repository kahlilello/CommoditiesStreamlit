    - In order to pip install, will need to refer to the pip folder (/usr/bin/pip3). Ex: /usr/bin/pip3 install matplotlib
    - Streamlit side will be based off of: 
        https://github.com/aicglabs/meetups-and-webinars/blob/main/2022-06-27--Meetup-Snowflake-Streamlit/streamlit_meetup.ipynb
    - Run the python file using the command (streamlit run pythonFile.py)
    - To access Macbook hiddens (.), use cmd + shift + period.
        - The path to libs: /Users/meLOL  /Library/Python/3.9/lib/python
    - Streamlit allows for multiple pages. This is done by created a sidebar code in the main page and a 'pages' folder for the other pages
